# Your First Query


---

## Content

Remember the first piece of SQL code we showed you earlier?

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This code retrieves **all** the data from the `users` table. It's often used to inspect what's inside a database.

> 💡 If you want to try this query yourself, check the *Learn More* section for a playground link. In there you'll be able to run this query, or try anything else. Go crazy, see what other data you can extract.

Enough talk! From the next workout, things will get exciting and practical.

Pretty much all the insights from now on will teach you how to **build more complicated and useful queries**.
