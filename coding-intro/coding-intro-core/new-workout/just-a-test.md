# Conditions and Loops

---
## Content

It's time to introduce the core tools for making logical decisions and repeating commands within programs.

### Conditions

In computers, there's no maybe. Every question is answered with a *yes* or a *no*. Every choice with a *do* or *don't*.

Imagine that you were writing an app to control a lightbulb. The core of your logic would be a binary decision. If the switch is on, the bulb shines light, otherwise it doesn't.

> 💡 In fact, the word `if` is the essential tool in most programming languages for writing conditional *yes*/*no* logic.

### Loops

Loops allow a program to do a command any number of times.

Picture playing your favorite song on repeat. The command `play` is looped over every time the song is finished.

We only have to write the command `play` once and then use a loop to repeat it until a user presses stop.

> 💡 Loops let us repeat doing a command any number of times
